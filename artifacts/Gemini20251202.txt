## Project State Summary - 2025-12-02

### Overall Goal
To build a robust, well-tested, and professional suite of tools for interacting with and monitoring a RabbitMQ server, ensuring that all tools emanate from a single, hierarchical source of truth.

### Last Session Summary
We successfully implemented spec-driven development to add a new feature to our `topology-creator`.
1.  **Problem:** We identified that the `topology-creator` was ignoring the `priority` field in our `message_types.json` design document, violating our core principle of "emanating from the tree."
2.  **Specification:** We corrected our documentation process by removing non-standard comments from the JSON file and creating a formal `artifacts/README.md` to document the design and the behavior of the `priority` field.
3.  **Implementation:** We updated the `topology-creator` to read the `priority` field. If the value is greater than 0, it now correctly sets the `x-max-priority` argument when declaring the queue.
4.  **Verification:** We ran the updated tool and confirmed from its output that it was correctly identifying and creating priority queues based on the spec.
5.  **Version Control:** All work was committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

### == IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP ==
The `topology-creator` is now more robust. The next logical step is to enhance our **testing framework** to verify this new priority queue feature.

-   **Task:** Create a new test script, `test_priority_queues.sh`.
-   **Implementation:** This test will be more advanced than our previous ones.
    1.  It will use the `test-producer` to send two messages to a priority queue (e.g., `order.placed`) in the **wrong order**: first a high-priority message, then a low-priority message.
    2.  To do this, we will first need to enhance the `test-producer` to accept a `--priority` command-line argument.
    3.  It will then use the `test-consumer` twice in a row.
    4.  It will assert that the **high-priority message was received first**, even though it was sent second.
-   **Goal:** Prove that our topology is not only being created correctly, but that it is behaving correctly under real-world conditions.
