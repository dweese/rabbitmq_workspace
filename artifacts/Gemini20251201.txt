## Project State Summary - 2025-12-01

### Overall Goal
To build a robust, well-tested, and professional suite of tools for interacting with and monitoring a RabbitMQ server.

### Last Session Summary
We successfully designed and implemented a complete integration testing framework for our messaging system. This was a major undertaking that included:
1.  **Creating a `messaging_tests` Crate:** A new, dedicated home for all integration testing logic.
2.  **Building Test Utilities:** We created a `test-producer` and a `test-consumer` binary, allowing us to script message publication and consumption.
3.  **Implementing Environment Variable Authentication:** We refactored all binaries (`rabbitmq-mon`, `test-producer`, `test-consumer`) to accept the `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` environment variable, enabling non-interactive execution, which is crucial for automation.
4.  **Creating an Automated Test Script:** We wrote our first automated test, `test_user_creation.sh`, which orchestrates the producer and consumer to verify the end-to-end message flow.
5.  **Debugging and Execution:** We diagnosed and fixed several subtle issues related to script execution (`source` vs. direct execution) and inter-process communication (password handling), resulting in a robust and reliable test script.

All work was successfully committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

### == IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP ==
The testing framework is now in place. The next logical step is to expand our test suite to cover more scenarios from our design document (`artifacts/message_types.json`).

-   **Task:** Create new test scripts for other message types.
-   **Example:** Create a `test_order_placement.sh` script that is a copy of `test_user_creation.sh` but is modified to test the `order.placed` message type on the `events` exchange.
-   **Goal:** Build a small suite of test scripts, one for each major message type, to ensure our entire topology is working as designed.
