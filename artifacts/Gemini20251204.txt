## Project State Summary - 2025-12-04

### Overall Goal
To build a robust, well-tested, and professional suite of tools for interacting with and monitoring a RabbitMQ server.

### Last Session Summary
We successfully created a high-level `README.md` for the entire workspace. This was a crucial documentation step that involved:
1.  **Defining the Content:** We outlined the key sections for a good README, including the project's goal, its core philosophy ("emanate from the tree"), a breakdown of the crates, and a guide to the main developer workflows.
2.  **Creating the Document:** We authored the `README.md` file, providing a clear and professional entry point for any developer looking at the project.
3.  **Version Control:** The new documentation was committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

This session was focused on improving the project's "curb appeal" and making it more maintainable and understandable in the long term.

### == IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP ==
With the high-level documentation in place, the next logical step is to return to our testing plan and continue expanding our test suite.

-   **Task:** Create more test scripts based on the existing templates to cover more of our defined message types.
-   **Example:** Create `test_inventory_update.sh` and `test_payment_processed.sh` to cover the remaining event types.
-   **Goal:** Have one automated test script for every message type defined in `artifacts/message_types.json`, giving us a comprehensive regression suite that can be run with a single command (`./messaging_tests/run_all_tests.sh`).
