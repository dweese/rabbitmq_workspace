## Project State Summary - 2025-12-03

### Overall Goal
To build a robust, well-tested, and professional suite of tools for interacting with and monitoring a RabbitMQ server.

### Last Session Summary
We successfully enhanced our messaging test framework and addressed significant technical debt in our existing test suite.
1.  **Test-Driven Cleanup:** We discovered that the tests for the `rabbitmq-config` crate were failing due to earlier refactoring. We methodically worked through all failing tests, updating them to use the modern `RabbitMQConfig` struct and bringing the entire test suite back to a passing state.
2.  **Priority Queue Testing:** We enhanced the `test-producer` utility to accept a `--priority` command-line argument, allowing us to send prioritized messages.
3.  **New Automated Test:** We created a new, sophisticated test script, `test_priority_queues.sh`, which verifies that our priority queues correctly process messages in priority order, even when they are sent out of order.
4.  **Housekeeping:** We cleaned up unused imports and committed all of our work, including the new tests and the fixes to the old ones.

All work was successfully committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

### == IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP ==
The testing framework is now more powerful and the codebase is cleaner. The next logical step is to continue expanding our test coverage to ensure all parts of our design are validated.

-   **Task:** Create more test scripts based on the existing templates.
-   **Example:** Create `test_inventory_update.sh` and `test_payment_processed.sh` to cover the remaining event types.
-   **Goal:** Have one automated test script for every message type defined in `artifacts/message_types.json`, giving us a comprehensive regression suite that can be run with a single command (`./messaging_tests/run_all_tests.sh`).
