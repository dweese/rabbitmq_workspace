## Project State Summary - 2025-11-30

### Overall Goal
To build a robust, well-tested, and professional suite of tools for interacting with and monitoring a RabbitMQ server.

### Last Session Summary
We designed and implemented the foundation for a new messaging integration testing framework. This involved creating a new `messaging_tests` crate within the workspace. We built two key utilities within this crate:
1.  A `test-producer` binary capable of publishing a message to a specific exchange and routing key.
2.  A `test-consumer` binary capable of consuming a single message from a specific queue, printing its payload, and then exiting.

We successfully tested the full message lifecycle by using the producer to send a message and the consumer to receive and verify it. All of this work was committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

### == IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP ==
The foundation of the testing framework is complete. The next logical step is to use these new utilities to create an automated test script.

-   **Task:** Create a new shell script, e.g., `messaging_tests/scripts/test_user_creation.sh`.
-   **Implementation:** This script will:
    1.  Run the `test-consumer` in the background, redirecting its output to a temporary file.
    2.  Run the `test-producer` to send a known "user.create" message.
    3.  Wait for the consumer to finish.
    4.  Use `grep` or a similar tool to assert that the temporary file contains the expected message payload.
    5.  Print "Test PASSED" or "Test FAILED" based on the result.

### 📖 Current `WORKSPACE_TODO.txt`
The main project to-do list is up-to-date. The work we've just completed is the first major step towards building a comprehensive test suite for the project.

### Key Files Modified in This Session
- `messaging_tests/` (new crate)
- `rabbitmq-config/src/client.rs` (added `consume_one` method)
- `rabbitmq-config/src/error.rs` (added new error variants)
- `rabbitmq-config/src/lib.rs` (exported `RabbitMQMessage`)
- `Cargo.toml` (root workspace file)
